The Python package google drive facilitates access to files uploaded to Google Drive.

<br>

# Installation
```
pip install googledriver
```

<br>

# Features
`Simple Download` <br>
If you simply want to save to the local storage full path through the URL for sharing on Google Drive, use the following.
```python
from googledriver import download

URL = 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/xxxxxxxxx/view?usp=share_link'
download(URL, './model/tf_gpt2_model')
```

<br>

`Download as Cached` <br>
If you want to download the cache file by URL and return the path, use the following.

```python
from googledriver import download

URL = 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/xxxxxxxxx/view?usp=share_link'
cached_path = download(URL, None, 'tf_model')
```
Basically, torch cached is used, and the huggingface hub module is used as a reference and wrapped.
